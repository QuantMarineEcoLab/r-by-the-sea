Most of his work is focused on marine systems, especially fisheries and spatial planning. Easton currently conducts research on assessing the effectiveness of protected area networks, improving species monitoring programs, and modeling socio-ecological systems in the context of fisheries. His work centers on how environmental variability, in particular rare events (e.g., hurricanes, COVID-19 pandemic), affects ecosystems and those that depend on them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmily Malcolm-White\n\n\n(she/her)\n\n\nLecturer Department of Mathematics and Statistics Middlebury College\n\n\nEmily Malcolm-White is an educator and student support specialist with a love for developing and teaching quantitative skills to students from a wide variety of backgrounds.
