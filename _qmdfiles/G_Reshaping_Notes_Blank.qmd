# Reshaping with Pivoting -- Why? 

Data frames are often described as wide or long. 

*Wide* when a row has more than one observation, and the units of observation are on one row each

*Long* when a row has only one observation, but the units of observation are repeated down the column

# `portal` dataset 

```{r}
#LOAD PACKAGES
library(tidyverse)

#LOAD DATA
portal_rodent <- read.csv("https://github.com/weecology/PortalData/raw/main/Rodents/Portal_rodent.csv")
```


```{r}
portal_wgt_summary <- portal_rodent %>%
  filter(!is.na(wgt)) %>%
  group_by(plot, species) %>%
  summarize(mean_wgt = mean(wgt))
```

# Pivot Wider

```{r}

```



# Pivot Longer

```{r}

```

# Challenge

Reshape the rodents data frame with year as columns, plot as rows, and the number of species per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping, and use the function `n_distinct()` to get the number of unique species within a particular chunk of data. Itâ€™s a powerful function! See ?n_distinct for more.

```{r}

```
