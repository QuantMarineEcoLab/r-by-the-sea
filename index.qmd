## Course Overview

::: {.g-col-7}

Welcome to **"R by the Sea: Data Analysis in the Marine Sciences"** -- a two-week boot camp style course designed to help you harness the power of R for ecological and environmental research through project-based learning. Typically, we meet virtually for the first week and then we transition to the [Shoals Marine Lab on Appledore Island](https://www.shoalsmarinelaboratory.org/) for the second week of the course. This course provides a unique opportunity to enhance your skills in R programming working hands-on with real-life data surrounded by the natural beauty and biodiversity of the Gulf of Maine.
